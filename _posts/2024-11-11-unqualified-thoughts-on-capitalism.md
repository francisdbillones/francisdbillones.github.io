title: unqualified and unpolished thoughts on capitalism
---

tl;dr: capitalism is not inherently flawed, and pursuing profits is not inherently evil.
it is a game, and when evil is legal in the game, you cannot blame winners for playing optimally.

I thought of this while sitting in a lecture about faith and capitalism. The message being
communicated by the professor was quite honestly not bad on its own—the same old
"we have to think about God and morality when making business decisions". Obviously
not a bad philosophy for running companies, and I can certainly think of a few that ought
to do that more.

When I thought about it a little deeper, though, I realized that it is quite literally
impossible to do that in real life, outside of an ethics professors' utopia where
everyone acts in everyone else's best interest. This is not a dig at ethics professors,
by the way—every field has its own utopia upon which it bases its teachings upon. Economics
assumes everyone thinks rationally when making economic decisions, and programmers assume
people actually care about performance.

Kidding aside, the notion that entities in a capitalist system must follow *some* basic
moral philosophy to not delve into anarchy and chaos is not something new nor novel. Obviously,
Apple would obviously **love** to kill every competitor it had, but it can't.

It becomes a little harder to distinguish between what is moral and what isn't when we
talk about actions that don't drive deep into our primitive natures. Killing is something
that no one would like to see, nor do (and if you do, there's a medical term for you). [Making
specialized hardware that can't be fixed by an independent technician](https://www.theverge.com/2024/2/9/24067957/apple-right-to-repair-oregon-bill-parts-pairing-ban) is something that we
unfortunately didn't have to evolve an aversion to, and so lives in a much grayer area
ethically speaking.

Usually, when companies commit egregious sins against humanity, it is (and *always* is)
in pursuit of profits. This is the main driver of capitalism—fierce competition starves
the weak and unoptimal and rewards the strong and efficient. Obviously, this formula works.
Advancements in technology, logistics, and manufacturing that make the world as abundant
as it is today is a direct result of capitalism's competition.

In pursuit of abundance, players in the capitalist game throw away morality in favor
of efficiency. Nestlé is allegedly [privatizing water](https://forloveofwater.org/water-privatization-the-struggle-to-stop-nestles-groundwater-grab-continues/),
[shrinkflation](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/inflation-shrinkflation-skimpflation-toilet-paper-candy-cereal-lendingtree/) has led to consumers paying more
for the same product, and ["modern day slavery"](https://www.npr.org/sections/goatsandsoda/2023/02/01/1152893248/red-cobalt-congo-drc-mining-siddharth-kara) is
happening in regions of South Africa rich with rare earth metals used in the manufacturing of batteries.

So is capitalism inherently flawed? A lot of people seem to think so, but I think (and I think
this is the view most people arrive at) that with an adequate system of checks and balances, as well
as good policy enforcement, a lot of these problems can be avoided.

For those of you rolling your eyes, yes—having a good controlling body that regulates
a capitalist system is an entire problem on its own. However, I think a lot of the discord around
this topic comes from a disproportionate amount of attention being paid towards the evil
actions of companies that are simply acting in their own best interests according to the
rules of the game.
